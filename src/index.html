        <h2>The Need</h2>
        <p>
          Teenagers today experience challenges unlike any other age group. Peer pressure, questions about their sexual
          orientation and gender identity, difficult home lives, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse are just a few
          of the struggles they face. They are searching for meaning and direction in the midst of an increasingly
          complex world, and many feel hopeless. Despite those challenges, God is drawing high school students to
          himself and giving them his hope and love.

      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Caleb and Amy have been on staff with Cru (formerly Campus Crusade for Christ) since 2016 and have served in
        Dallas since 2020. We are both passionate about bringing the good news of the hope of Jesus to high school
        students who wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise hear about him.

          <h2>Win</h2>
          <p>
            We win students to Christ by going to where they are and boldly presenting the gospel. This happens through
            outreaches to sports teams and other groups of students as well as small group evangelism.

          <p>
            We build students up in their faith through weekly meetings and small group discipleship to help them know,
            love, and obey Jesus more.

          <h2>Send</h2>
          <p>
            We send students out to reach their schools and the world for Christ. That happens through equipping and
            empowering them to share Christ with their classmates and teammates and providing opportunities for them to
            take the gospel to the nations via mission trips.
